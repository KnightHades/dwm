# dwm (dynamic window manager)

Here's my build of DWM. It's got a few patches installed, and other changes.

# Patches
- vanitygaps
- actualfullscreen
- attachbottom

# Features
You can press Mod+W to bring up Firefox.
Uh...
That's it.

# Requirements
You need st for it to work, but you can go into config.h and change it to any other terminal if you want.
I'd recommend using dmenu with this build.

Cheers.

# Installation
Alright, here's how you install it, if you don't know how already.
```
git clone https://github.com/arcticfrostx/dwm.git
```
```
