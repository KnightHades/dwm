# dwm (dynamic window manager)

Here's my build of DWM. It's got a few patches installed, and other changes.

# Patches
- vanitygaps
- actualfullscreen
- attachbottom

# Installation
Alright, here's how you install it, if you don't know how already.
```
git clone https://github.com/arcticfrostx/dwm.git
```
```
cd dwm/
```
```
sudo make clean install
```
# Requirements
You need st for it to work, but you can go into config.h and change it to any other terminal if you want.

Cheers.
